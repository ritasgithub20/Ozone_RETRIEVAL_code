% This file should be ran from the same directory where the AOSData.mat 
% files and the ECMWF_tfiles and ECMWF_zfiles directories are stored
%
% collects all mat files from the current directory (including subdirectories) 
% only saves data from good measurements (>= 3h measurements)
%
% once 3h measurements are selected each measurement is processed 
% separately and parameters needed by TestOEM.arts are extracted. 
% y and f_backend coressponding to each measurement are extracted from 
% the spec{} structure of each .mat file, while ecmwf data files are
% selected from the ECMWF_tfiles and ECWMF_zfiles by calculating 
% the minimum difference between the date and time of the measurement
% and and date and time of the ecmwf_t and ecmwf_z files.
% 
% for each processed measurement there will be a sequence of subdirectories
% created based on the date and hour of the measurement where y, f, 
% ecmwf_t and ecmwf_z will be stored
